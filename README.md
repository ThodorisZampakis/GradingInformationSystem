INFORMATION GRADING SYSTEM FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MACEDONIA

This grading system allows students to register and view their grades, and secretaries to submit final grades.
To check operations related to a teacher, go to the Main2.java class to find the default teacher names.
To log in as a secretary, simply register with the default keyword "secretary" and fill in both the ID and password fields.
This way, the system understands that you are logging in as a secretary.
